        title: "1. The Lost Puppy",
        content: `
        Once upon a time, a little puppy named Max lived with his family in a small cozy house near a park.
        One sunny morning, Max followed a colorful butterfly and wandered far away.
        When the butterfly flew away, Max realized he was lost. He felt scared and sat under a tree, whimpering softly.<br><br>

        A kind girl named Lily saw Max and gently picked him up. She noticed his collar had a small name tag with his family’s phone number.
        She called the number, and soon Max’s family came running with happy tears in their eyes.
        They hugged Lily and thanked her for helping their little puppy return home.<br><br>

        From that day on, Max never wandered far again, and Lily visited him every weekend to play.

        title: "2. The Brave Little Rabbit",
        content: `
        In a big forest filled with tall trees and singing birds, lived a tiny rabbit named Coco.
        One morning, Coco heard a soft cry. A baby bird had fallen from its nest high up in a tree.
        All the animals were scared to help because the nest was too high.<br><br>

        Coco took a deep breath, gathered his courage, and carefully climbed the tree.
        With small steady steps, he reached the nest and gently placed the baby bird inside.
        The mother bird chirped joyfully and thanked Coco for his bravery.<br><br>

        All the animals cheered and admired Coco, even though he was the smallest.

        content: `
        Emma loved to paint beautiful flowers, trees, and animals. One evening, she found a shiny paintbrush near a river.
        When she painted a flower on a rock, a real flower suddenly bloomed there!<br><br>

        Emma was amazed! She painted fruit for hungry children, built houses for the poor with her magic brush, and created colorful gardens in her village.<br><br>

        Everyone in the village became happy and thankful. Emma used the magic brush only to help others and never for herself.

        content: `
        A mighty lion was sleeping under a tree when a little mouse ran across his paw.
        The lion woke up, caught the mouse, and growled angrily.<br><br>

        “Please don’t eat me! I promise I will help you one day,” squeaked the mouse.
        The lion laughed but let him go.<br><br>

        A few days later, the lion got trapped in a hunter’s net. He roared loudly for help.
        The little mouse heard him and came running. He chewed the ropes until the lion was free.<br><br>

        The lion thanked the mouse and they became best friends.

        title: "5. The Honest Woodcutter",
        content: `
        A poor woodcutter was cutting wood near a river when his axe slipped from his hand and fell into the water.
        He sat by the riverbank and cried sadly.<br><br>

        Suddenly, a fairy appeared and asked why he was crying.
        When he told her, she dived into the river and brought out a golden axe. The woodcutter said, “That's not mine.”<br><br>

        Then she brought out a silver axe. Again, he said, “Not mine.”
        Finally, she brought his old iron axe. He smiled and said, “Yes, that one is mine.”<br><br>

        The fairy was happy with his honesty and gave him all three axes.

        content: `
        In a jungle, there lived a gentle elephant named Ella. She was big, but she had a soft and caring heart.
        One day, she saw a tiny turtle struggling to cross a fast-flowing river.<br><br>

        Ella gently lifted the turtle with her trunk and helped him cross safely.
        The turtle thanked her and smiled.<br><br>

        A week later, Ella herself got stuck in a deep muddy pit. She tried to climb out but couldn't.
        The turtle saw her and called his animal friends. Together, they pulled Ella out.<br><br>

        From that day, Ella and the turtle remained best friends.

        content: `
        In a bright garden, a little sunflower named Sunny loved to sleep late.
        Every morning, while other flowers stretched towards the sun, Sunny stayed asleep.<br><br>

        One day, a butterfly told Sunny, “You miss the warm sunshine, the songs of birds, and the morning breeze!”<br><br>

        Sunny decided to wake up early the next morning. He saw golden sunlight, heard birds sing, and felt happy for the first time.<br><br>

        From that day on, Sunny woke up with the sun and smiled every morning.

        title: "8. The Little Star",
        content: `
        Far up in the night sky lived a little star named Twinkle. She was smaller and dimmer than the other stars.
        She felt sad and thought she wasn’t special.<br><br>

        One night, she saw a lonely child looking out of the window. Twinkle shone as brightly as she could to make the child smile.
        The child smiled and whispered, “Thank you, little star.”<br><br>

        Twinkle felt warm and happy inside. She understood that even a small star can light up someone’s world.
